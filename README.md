# Image Classification

## Overview
This is the second project of the Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree in Udacity. In this project, the goal is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. We bulid the classifier by using the convolution neural network (CNN) and apply some techniques such as max pooling, dropout, batch normalization and fully connected layers to get better accuracy.
